                 <p><b>The Four Pillars of STEM</b><br>
                    ✔ Science: The study of the universe and its intricacies. From the vastness of space to the microscopic realm, science seeks to understand and explain phenomena, driving the innate human curiosity.<br>
                    ✔ Technology: An embodiment of the human spirit to innovate. Technology encompasses tools, systems, and devices developed from the application of scientific knowledge, designed to streamline processes and solve problems.<br>
                    ✔ Engineering: The application of scientific principles to design and build. Engineering transforms theoretical knowledge into tangible solutions, bridging the gap between imagination and reality.<br>
                    ✔ Mathematics: The universal language. Mathematics provides the foundation upon which scientific theories and technological innovations are built, offering structured logic to quantify and solve complex problems.<br>
                     Embracing <b>STEM 🎯</b> is not just about fostering future scientists and engineers; it's about equipping the next generation with the tools to understand, question, and shape the world around them.</p><br>
